# weather-data-analysis
The aim of this project is to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of historical weather data collected over the course of a year. The dataset includes various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and atmospheric pressure, along with categorical data describing weather conditions. The primary objective is to derive meaningful insights from the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis, which can aid in understanding weather patterns and trends over time.

Key Objectives:

Data Exploration: Conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, dimensions, and attributes. This involves checking for missing values, identifying data types, and understanding the range and distribution of each variable.

Descriptive Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and variance for relevant variables like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This will provide a summary of the central tendency, variability, and distribution of the data.

Visualization: Utilize various visualization techniques including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and time series plots to visually explore relationships between different variables and uncover patterns or trends over time.

Weather Condition Analysis: Analyze the frequency and distribution of different weather conditions recorded throughout the year. This includes identifying the most common weather conditions, as well as occurrences of extreme weather events such as snowstorms or thunderstorms.

Impact of Weather on Visibility: Investigate the relationship between weather conditions and visibility, examining how factors like fog, rain, or snow affect visibility levels.

Wind Speed Analysis: Explore the distribution of wind speeds recorded and identify instances of high wind speeds. Additionally, analyze the relationship between wind speed and other meteorological variables.

Expected Outcomes:

A comprehensive understanding of historical weather patterns based on the provided dataset.
Identification of key trends, seasonal variations, and extreme weather events.
Insights into the impact of weather conditions on visibility and wind speed.
Visualizations and statistical summaries that can be used to communicate findings effectively.
Potential Applications:

Decision-making in various sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and urban planning, based on weather forecasts and historical trends.
Climate research and environmental studies to understand long-term weather patterns and their implications.
Development of predictive models for forecasting future weather conditions.
